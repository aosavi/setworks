# Setworks

Setworks are networks of complex set intersections. Setworks are set visualizations that scale. Read the [preprint](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kj7vg) if you'd like to know more.

Setworks do not depend on a particular programming language. Grab a pen and paper, or a sophisticated package dedicated to graphs in the language of your choice.

The [Shiny app](https://aosavi.shinyapps.io/setworks/) demonstrates setworks in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), powered by [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/).

Use of the web app is limited to 25 hours per month. If it is no longer available, just download this repository and run the app in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

## Contribute

Suggestions are welcome. Also, feel free to share examples of great setworks, or packages (in any language) that work well with setworks. If you create a [reprex](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) and share it on [gist](https://gist.github.com/), I'll post it here.

## Alternative Approaches

Setworks may not suit your specific needs. Here is a list of alternative approaches to visualizing large numbers of intersections.
